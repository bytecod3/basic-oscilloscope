## Usage
### Powering 
The oscilloscope uses either 12V DC jack adapter or a 9V battery. You can only use one at a time. 
To use the 12V adapter, plug in the jack into the DC Jack located at the top right of the board. To use the 9V battery,
you should have a battery holder with two wires protruding, for +ve and -ve side. Fix these wires on the terminal block located at the top right corner of the board. 
Finally is to toggle the slide-switch located on the right edge of the board.  
On both cases, a green LED should light indicating that the oscilloscope is fully powered. 

To switch off the oscilloscope, toggle the slide-switch agin to the direction labelled OFF on the board silkscreen.
